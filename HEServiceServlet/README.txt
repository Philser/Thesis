This is the helper project for the Computation service.

As the HEServiceGenerator holds the static code files of the computation service in a .zip file, this project is just for convenience.
You can adapt the computation service to your likings, zip the project and place it at [...]\HEServiceGenerator\src\main\java\resources\service_servlet\servlet.zip.

Note that the project is not runnable on its own, as some classes are missing from it.
These classes are dynamically created by the HEServiceGenerator before a computation service is deployed.
